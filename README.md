# Hand-written-digit-prediction

The project involves the classification of handwritten digits using various Naive Bayes models, both from the scikit-learn library and implemented from scratch. The dataset used is the Optical Recognition of Handwritten Digits, which consists of 8x8 images of hand-written digits from 0 to 9.

The analysis begins with the loading and exploration of the dataset using scikit-learn. Data preprocessing includes flattening the images and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets. Three Naive Bayes models—Bernoulli, Gaussian, and Multinomial—are implemented using both scikit-learn and custom implementations.
The scikit-learn models are evaluated for accuracy and presented with detailed classification reports.

Visualization is incorporated to provide a comparative overview of the models' performances, using bar plots to display accuracy scores. The project showcases the successful application of Naive Bayes models for digit classification, emphasizing both the scikit-learn library's convenience and the understanding gained through implementing models from scratch. The Gaussian Naive Bayes model, both from scikit-learn and implemented from scratch, achieves the highest accuracy, demonstrating the effectiveness of Naive Bayes in this image classification task.
